  <h1>User Experience Designer/Developer, Data Portal Team, CareerBuilder, Chicago, IL; March 2012—October 2013</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Joined company as a consultant, collaborating with business owners, project managers and developers to overhaul the UX.</li>
    <h2>UX Lead</h2>
    <li>Conducted baseline and in-depth usability tests with external and internal users. Recorded and edited videos, and presented snippets and findings with the team.

Interviewed users, created personas, and represented the user’s voice in team meetings.</li>
    <li>Conducted cross-departmental brainstorm sessions during project kickoff, using collaborative critique (Design Studio) model.</li>
    <h2>Front-end Developer</h2>
    <li>Our team's product ownership was weak and lacked design direction. I devoted after-hours time to redesigns, persuaded business owners to green-light them, and implemented them. Examples: Search page, overview, menu/navigation organization, and visual (graphical) work.</li>
    <li>Refactored JavaScript, CSS, and VB.NET code eliminating 3000+ lines, and implemented object-oriented JavaScript solutions to ease future code maintenance. Participated in creative Hackday idea and presented a solution to repossess 20% of screen space.</li>
    <h2>Interaction Designer</h2>
    <li>Designed and implemented numerous interactive prototypes for complex data filtering UI project. Tested prototypes with internal and external users; recommended a final solution that I later implemented both front-end and back-end (VB &amp; C# .NET, SQL Server).</li>
    <h2>Evangelizer</h2>
    <li>Continuously shared knowledge with the team about UX in Agile/Lean development, leading to better team organization with dual-track sprints.</li>

  <ul>
    <h2>Full-stack Developer</h2>
    <li>Ground-up development of Ruby on Rails applications cloud-hosted on Heroku and EngineYard.</li>
    <li>Noticing a front-end skills gap, I conducted JavaScript training with the team on key concepts such as closures, scope, hoisting, and execution context.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated 75% decrease in API hits by implementing response caching. This significantly reduced the load on the API servers and boosted our Rails application's responsiveness (lower request queue time).</li>
    <li>Created a widget service Rails solution served to our clients via a request to load JavaScript on their pages.</li>
    <l1>As senior engineer on the teams, I monitored server failures using NewRelic, and tweaked application instances and load balancers.</l1>
